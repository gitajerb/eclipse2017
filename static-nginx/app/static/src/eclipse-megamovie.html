The <a href='/'>Megamovie video</a> was pieced together from images collected by citizen scientists at various points along the <a href='http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2017Aug21Tgoogle.html' target='_blank'>eclipse path</a>. This provided a continuous datasets that far exceeds what any one person could capture from a single location."

By stitching together thousands of images taken along the <a href='http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEgoogle/SEgoogle2001/SE2017Aug21Tgoogle.html' target='_blank'>path of the 2017 total solar eclipse</a>, we have a unique treasure-trove of information on how the corona changes over time. Radio-wave studies have allowed us to closely observe very rapid variations of the corona, but now we expect to study such processes directly using visible light and thus enrich our knowledge of the Sun’s dynamic atmosphere considerably. The data gathered via the Eclipse Megamovie Project will be made available publicly and are expected to allow scientists to analyze the Sun’s corona for many years to come. Furthermore, there is an opportunity to repeat this experiment when another total eclipse crosses the U.S. in 2024. This will show how the Sun changes over a few hours, but also how it’s different after a period of seven years."

From this beginning, the basic idea of the project has always been “to incorporate as many images as possible [of the 2017 total solar eclipse], provided by a diverse range of observers using standard photographic techniques, into an overview movie.” The idea of the Megamovie has now been discussed by many other members of the astronomy community; out of these discussions the current team was formed."
